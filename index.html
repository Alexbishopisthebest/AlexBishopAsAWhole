    <h1>Alex Bishops art </h1>
        <h2> About me</h2>
            <p>Hello I am Alex Bishop, I am a fifteen-year-old artist. I specialize in the art style of realism. I have been drawing
            and painting for many years, art is my passion. As you will see throughout the time that you are on my web page, I
            like to do mainly self-portraits.<img src="https://alexbishopisthebest.github.io/IMG_0667.jpeg" width="200"
                                          height="200" alt />
            </p>
        <h2>My Art</h2>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KU2OZkD.png" width="460.5" height="212.5" alt <p> This painting is a portrait of the character Hannibal Lecter from the film "Silence of the Lambs" (1991). This portrait took me around 26 hours to complete over the span of 3 months. I used mainly gouache paint for this, but I also utilized pencil and created the sketch digitally. The painting depicts a stark and unsettling scene where Hannibal is shown listening to music in his cell after just having killed Officer Bill Boyle. This painting aims to convey a sense of despair and violence, which I believe I captured well through the contrast of colors and the use of perspective.</p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3uaH5hi.png" width="460.5" height="252" alt <p> This is a portrait of an eye done with colored pencil and pen. The artwork is a close-up drawing of my eye in the style of realism. It meticulously captures the intricate features and textures of a human eye, paying careful attention to the interplay of light and shadow. The result is a highly detailed and lifelike depiction that highlights the nuances of the eye's structure, from the delicate lashes to the subtle reflections on the iris and cornea. Overall, I hope that the expression in the eye properly conveys fear.</p>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gk6mXv9.png" width="460.5" height="685.5" alt <p> This painting features myself with a surreal, otherworldly appearance. I am depicted with long black hair and greenish-blue skin, giving me a celestial quality. My head is tilted slightly upward as if pondering the sky above me. Behind me is a radiant, golden-yellow beam of light, resembling a gap in the red background, creating a powerful, glowing aura that suggests enlightenment, divinity, and spiritual awakening. Beside me, there are two outline sketches of my side profile. The use of red for the profiles and background creates a cohesive color scheme, while the golden halo provides a striking focal point. Hopefully, the use of contrasting colors and symbolic imagery evokes themes of inner reflection and the duality of existence. My upward gaze and the radiant halo suggest a connection to higher consciousness or an otherworldly realm, embodying a god-like presence.</p

    <img src="https://imgur.com/uIjzpVM" width="460.5" height="670" alt<p This is a light study of the dynamics of light on a hand pointing directly at the light. In this portrait, it was much harder to portray the emotion of longing for something or the emotion of fear, but I hope I was successful in depicting the way light interacts with the hand. I tried to show the proper values of skin and the way shadows fall on it. This portrait has a deep blue background that fades into the spotlight. I think this piece could also emulate the idea of someone reaching to be in the spotlight yet never quite making it. I hope this piece shows emotion better than if there were a face. Overall, this piece took 2 hours, and I used colored pencils for the composition. />

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JR7AQCz.png" width="460.5" height="649.311231395" alt <p> This is a portrait of Mads Mikkelsen's portrayal of Hannibal Lecter from Hannibal NBC. Even though this portrait is less detailed than the rest of the portraits on my page, I hope that it accurately portrays the lack of emotions that Hannibal has. Although he looks sad, he does not feel this way. In this piece, I hope it accurately conveys the level of insanity that the character has. For this portrait, I used graphite and pencil. Overall, it took me 30 minutes to create this.</p>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0zYrKWL.png" width="460.5" height="280" alt <p>This is a painting of myself. In this portrait, I used a lot of shading, mainly in the hair and face. I tried to convey the emotions of curiosity while still making it look like me. My head is very slightly tilted up, as if I were trying to see what was on my phone. Behind me is a shower curtain, suggesting that I am in the bathroom. I like to think that this artwork presents a dynamic and abstract composition that captures the viewer's attention with the use of color and texture. I tried to achieve that with the ruffles in the shower curtain and the splotchy tiles on the wall. In total, this piece took 5 hours, and I used colored pencils and gouache to create it.</p>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FdztT4l.png" width="460.5" height="543.598696461" alt <p>This last portrait is a drawing of myself and a death moth. I hope that the hair is eye-catching; I tried to achieve this with shades ranging from pastel pink to brighter, more intense hues, hopefully adding a playful and dynamic element to my appearance. My eyes are striking; I tried to render them with a piercing gaze that engages directly with the viewer. The eyebrows are well-defined, adding to the expressiveness of my eyes. I am still working on the outfit, but I hope to incorporate a hint of edginess that reflects a confident and unique personality. I like to think that this drawing encapsulates the essence of a confident and self-assured individual, exuding a distinctive sense of style and a bold, creative spirit. I strive to express this every day through the raw emotion in my art.</p>
